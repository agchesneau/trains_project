# Project
For this mid-bootcamp project, I am asking the following question : "how is the reliability of French national train lines affected by the cities of origin and destination ?"
# Data
For this project I used 2 datasets from https://ressources.data.sncf.com/pages/accueil/ : the regularity of "intercités" (regular speed) and TGV (high-speed).
I cleaned the data, checked the presence of a relationship between line and reliability/number of trains canceled using a chi² contingency table, exported it to a csv file and analyzed it in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/views/mid-project/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
